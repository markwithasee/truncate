truncate
========

Truncate is a jQuery plugin for shortening text in one or more content elements.

Invoking this method will limit elements' number of initially visible words, and will add a link to show (or hide) the full text.

It will also check for sentence-completing punctuation (. ? !) at the end of the cutoff word. If none exists, it will add ellipses.
