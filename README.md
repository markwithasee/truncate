truncate
========

Truncate is a jQuery plugin for shortening text in one or more content elements.

Invoking this method will limit elements' number of initially visible words, and will add a link to show (or hide) the full text. If the number of words in any of the elements is less than or equal to the limit, no link will appear.

It will also check for sentence-completing punctuation (. ? !) at the end of the cutoff word. If none exists, it will add ellipses.
